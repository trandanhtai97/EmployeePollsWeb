# Project: Employee Polls Web App

## Project Overview

You have been asked by the HR department of your company to build an application that employees can use internally. In order to improve collaboration and transparency within the company, every employee can access the application and create a poll with two proposed solutions. Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions have the most votes. In addition, HR has requested you have a dashboard that lists every employee ordered by the number of polls they've created and answered. To give employees incentive to use your application, HR will give a prize each quarter for the top employees who have created and answered the most polls.

In the "Employee Polls" Project, you'll build a web app that lets an employee create polls for coworkers. The process goes like this: An employee is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is not possible.

In your app, users will be able to answer polls, see which polls they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post polls, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
